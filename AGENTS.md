# AGENTS.md — AI Assistant Guide for abap2UI5 layout-management

> This file follows the cross-tool AGENTS.md convention and is the single
> agent instruction file of this repository — Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md`
> natively, there is no separate `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project Overview

Customizable table and form layouts with persistent variant management for
[abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) (`z2ui5_cl_layo_*`). Layout
variants are persisted to this addon's own database tables (`z2ui5_t_11`,
`z2ui5_t_12`).

**Language:** English — all code, comments, commit messages, PRs, issues and
documentation must be in English.

## Package Structure

| Package | Content |
|---|---|
| `src/01/`, `src/02/`, `src/03/` | Layout classes and samples (`z2ui5_cl_layo_*`) |

## Utility Access

The addon uses the legacy utility class `z2ui5_cl_util` directly
(`z2ui5_cl_util=>…`). It no longer ships with abap2UI5: it moved, with the
rest of the core's former `src/99/01`, to
[abap2UI5-ext](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-ext), which is a hard
dependency of this addon (installed alongside via abapGit and declared in the
abaplint configs - `main`, and its branch `702` for the downport check). No
vendored utility copy is kept (maintainer decision, for now).

## Dependencies

Installed alongside via abapGit; declared in the abaplint configs:

* [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5)
* [abap2UI5-ext](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5-ext) — `z2ui5_cl_util`, see "Utility Access"

## Coding Style

Follows the abap2UI5 core conventions (see its
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5/blob/main/AGENTS.md)): Clean
ABAP with Hungarian prefixes, backtick string literals, `xsdbool()`. After a
functional method call, do not read `sy-subrc` (it is undefined) — check the
returned value instead.

## Validation

Run `npm run check` before considering changes complete: it runs the same
abaplint, abap2UI5-linter and rename steps as CI, and all of them must pass.
CI:

* `abap-standard` / `abap-cloud` — lint against Standard ABAP
  (`abaplint.jsonc`) and ABAP Cloud (`.github/abaplint/abap_cloud.jsonc`)
* `check-abap2ui5` — the abap2UI5-linter over the app classes and their
  views (`abap2ui5lint.jsonc`)
* `publish-702` / `abap-702` — `publish-702` writes the downported `702`
  branch on every push to `main` (`npm run auto_downport`: `abaplint --fix`
  against `.github/abaplint/abap_702.jsonc`), and `abap-702` lints it
* `check-rename` — namespace-rename check (`npm run rename`, `.github/scripts/rename.mjs`)

All `.abap`/`.xml`/config files are LF-only (`.gitattributes` enforces it).

## Namespace rename

`npm run rename` (CI: `check-rename`) and the manual `build-rename` workflow
are abap2UI5's namespace rename for this addon - `.github/scripts/rename.mjs`,
the same file in every addon that has one. Every `z2ui5_` object becomes
`<name>_...`, for a customer name such as `ZMYUI5` or a registered namespace
such as `/CA2UI5/` (at most 10 characters), and so does every reference to
abap2UI5 and to the addons this one builds on: the branch `rename_<name>` runs
on an abap2UI5 renamed with the same name by its own `build-rename`. What
follows from it:

- Every object name has at most 25 characters (a transparent table
  11, an ICF node 10) - 30 minus what the longest new name adds.
- No literal names a `z2ui5_` object: the rename rewrites references, never a
  literal. Derive the name - from a typed reference, or behind the prefix of
  the class's own name.
- A change that spans several repositories: `RENAME_DEPS_FROM=<dir> npm run
  rename` takes the dependencies from the clones in `<dir>`.
